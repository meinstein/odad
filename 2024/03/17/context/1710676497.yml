notes: Bregman claims that half of (Dutch) people essentially work bullshit non-essential jobs and would be well-served to transition to something more meaningful. He argues that this happens because people are ambitious and therefore leave school going to certain jobs, but their efforts are misplaced and, frankly, making the world worse instead of better.
