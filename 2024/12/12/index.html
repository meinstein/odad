      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat a mix of olive oil and butter in an enameled cast
          iron Dutch Oven (or similar pot). Add chopped onions and sauté until soft and translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Stir in the chopped carrots and celery. Season lightly
          with salt as you go, layering flavors. Cook until the vegetables begin to soften.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorporate Meat and Garlic:</strong> Add the ground beef or turkey to the pan
          along with the minced garlic. Season with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Cook,
          stirring occasionally, until the meat is lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Milk:</strong> Pour in enough milk to submerge the mixture. Increase the heat
          to medium-high and cook until most of the milk has evaporated, stirring occasionally. If
          desired, add a pinch of nutmeg for warmth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deglaze with White Wine:</strong> Pour white wine into the pan, again covering the
          contents. Cook on medium-high heat, allowing the wine to reduce completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tomato Time:</strong> Stir in canned diced tomatoes. For additional depth, add
          fresh diced or sun-dried tomatoes at this stage. If needed, add a splash of water to
          maintain a saucy consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simmer Slowly:</strong> Reduce the heat to very low and let the sauce simmer
          gently for several hours. Stir occasionally, allowing the flavors to meld and the tomatoes
          to fully incorporate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Pair the sauce with your favorite pasta. Fusilli or rigatoni
          work especially well, but any pasta will do. Top generously with freshly grated Parmesan cheese
          for a perfect finish.
