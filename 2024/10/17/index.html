    <h2>INT. AMSTERDAM METRO - DAY</h2>

    <p>The train hums along, passengers leaning into their phones or gazing out the window. The
      metro
      cars are open and connected, giving everyone a clear view down the line.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a group of <strong>LOUD GERMAN TOURISTS</strong> breaks the calm, laughing and
      talking
      at full volume. Passengers shift uncomfortably, exchanging annoyed glances.</p>

    <p>A tall <strong>DUTCHMAN</strong> in punk clothes and a mohawk stands up, noticing the group.
      With
      an amused but serious look, he strides down the aisle toward them.</p>

    <p><strong>DUTCHMAN</strong><br>
      <em>(in Dutch-tinged German, pointing to the floor)</em><br>
      Du hast etwas verloren.
    </p>

    <p>The tourists pause, going quiet. They look down at the floor, bewildered, trying to figure
      out
      what they've lost.</p>

    <p><strong>DUTCHMAN</strong><br>
      <em>(shouting)</em><br>
      Den Krieg!
    </p>

    <p>The tourists look up, surprised, and then laughter erupts. The whole train joins in,
      releasing
      the tension in an unexpected moment of connection.</p>

    <p>The Dutchman heads back to his seat, and for a moment, history feels like it can take a joke.
