      <p>In the reptile house, the crocodile holds the crowd — parents and children press close to
        the
        glass, enthralled. Just behind them, by the iguana enclosure, an elderly lady leans on her
        walker,
        taking in the quiet corner.</p>

      <p>She lifts her hand, holding it beside the iguana's twisted claws. “Oh,” she says with a
        chuckle,
        “you've got rheumatoid arthritis too, I see.” A child darts over, sending the iguana
        scuttling
        away, claws clacking quickly on the rocks.</p>

      <p>The lady laughs, surprised by the burst of energy in her unlikely companion, feeling a
        quiet,
        shared strength in their crooked hands and well-worn joints. With a smile, she steadies her
        grip
        and turns, comforted by the company.</p>
