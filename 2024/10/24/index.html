      <p>In the reptile house, the crocodile commands attention as parents and children crowd around
        the
        glass. Just behind them, by the iguana enclosure, an elderly lady leans on her walker,
        taking in
        the quiet corner.</p>
      <p>She lifts her hand, holding it beside the iguana's twisted claws. “Oh,” she says with a
        chuckle,
        “you've got rheumatoid arthritis too, I see.” A child darts over, startling the iguana,
        which
        scurries away with surprising nimbleness, claws clacking on the rocks.</p>
      <p>The lady laughs, steadies her grip, then turns toward the crocodile, ready to face down
        another
        relic of time.</p>
