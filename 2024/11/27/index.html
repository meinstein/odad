        Taking on low-cost tech debt is like borrowing money at a low interest rate — it's a smart move when managed wisely. To keep the “interest rate” low, start with these two strategies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Strongly Typed Languages:</strong> Catch issues early and maintain a solid foundation as the codebase evolves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leave Clear Comments:</strong> Capture intent and context to guide future development and reduce guesswork.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To maximize the value of tech debt, employ these three strategies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Refinance with Refactoring:</strong> Regularly revisit and improve old hacks as better tools or practices become available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Up Sinking Funds with Incremental Fixes:</strong> Allocate small, steady development cycles to gradually address technical debt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leverage Returns by Prioritizing Impact:</strong> Use tech debt to deliver high-value features quickly, ensuring the benefits outweigh the costs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Just as low-cost financial debt can fuel growth, well-managed tech debt can accelerate delivery and innovation. Handle it strategically, and it pays for itself.
