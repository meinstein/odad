        Taking on low-cost tech debt is like borrowing money at a low interest rate—it’s a smart move when
        managed wisely. To keep the “interest rate” low, start with these strategies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Leave crystal-clear comments to capture intent and context.</li>
        <li>Use strongly typed languages to catch issues before they escalate.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To maximize the value of tech debt, employ these three approaches:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Refinance with Refactoring:</strong> Regularly revisit and improve old hacks as better
          tools or practices become available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Up Sinking Funds with Incremental Fixes:</strong> Allocate small, steady development
          cycles to gradually address technical debt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leverage Returns by Prioritizing Impact:</strong> Use tech debt to deliver high-value
          features quickly, ensuring the benefits outweigh the costs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Just as low-cost financial debt can fuel growth, well-managed tech debt can accelerate delivery
        and innovation. Handle it strategically, and it pays for itself.
