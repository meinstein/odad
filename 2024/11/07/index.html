      <p><em>Originally written in January 2017</em></p>
      <p>
        The day after Donald Trump's inauguration, I attended a large protest to which my friends on
        Facebook had invited me. I felt an obligation to go, carrying a sense of guilt for not being more
        engaged during the election. I planned to take an Uber for the 13-mile trip downtown, but the
        morning surge had fares hovering between $120 and $180. I opted instead for one of the many buses
        that course along Los Angeles's arterial boulevards.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I waited, my first encounter with a fellow protest-goer unfolded. An industry-looking type
        walked over, sheepishly asking me the bus fare. I briefly wondered why he'd chosen me to ask, but
        glancing around, the answer became clear. Apparently, I was supposed to share in his sense of
        displacement. I told him the standard fare, and without so much as a thank you,
        he turned to rummage in his pockets for the correct change. A young mother with her child, also
        heading to the protest, overheard and began loudly complaining about the bus's delay. She seemed
        to be seeking an ally, but I found it hard to indulge her anxiety. I assured her that the bus
        would arrive in due time — as it always does — but my reassurance was lost as she stomped into the
        street, scanning the horizon for any sign of it. A young homeless man, dozing on the bench behind
        us, flinched each time she exclaimed something.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, an empty bus rolled up, and we paid our fare to board. Over the next hour, a steady
        flow of protest-goers and regular riders trickled on. As we traveled further from my beachside
        neighborhood, the pink-hatted, sign-bearing crowd gradually gave way to housekeepers, construction
        workers, homeless men, and elderly Korean ladies with push carts. Their uniforms were the tools of
        working-class people, not the costumes of protest. The clash between our agendas could not have
        been more stark.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the bus crossed into the edges of L.A.'s gentrified territory, a few protest-goers started
        anxiously wondering aloud about which stop was ours. The regulars looked on with muted amusement as we reoriented ourselves. Others in our crowd chatted, trading disbelief over the idea of Donald Trump as president. A consensus surfaced: no one could fathom enduring his administration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bus buzzed with energy as helicopters appeared, weaving around skyscrapers in the distance.
        People pulled out their smartphones, gripping their signs and readying for action. Laughter burst
        here and there whenever someone revealed their political slogan for the day. Then, like sheep, we
        all poured off at a single stop, flowing toward the growing crowd across the street. As I made my
        way into the thick of things, the movement slowed to a crawl. Protesters would stop unpredictably,
        pausing to snap selfies or group shots. It felt intrusive to cross into someone's frame uninvited,
        yet nearly impossible to avoid. Somewhere in the distance, an echo of voices amplified by a PA
        system floated over the crowd, but I could never quite reach it. It almost felt as if the
        unstructured, wandering nature of the gathering was intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        I eventually found myself in a section lined with tents and portable toilets. Political
        organizations filled the tents, eagerly handing out pamphlets. I didn't take any; the surrounding
        bins were already overflowing. As I passed, a particularly long line caught my eye, unsurprisingly
        leading to a hip coffee shop, known for its gourmet beans and elite price tag.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while, I slipped away from the crowd to find some cellular service, feeling the need to
        process the day's events from the vantage of my Facebook feed. Wandering a few blocks, I found a
        sunny corner with a cafe and some outdoor seating. I leaned against a nearby wall, checking for a
        signal. While scrolling, I was interrupted by the sound of a woman yelling obscenities. I looked
        up to see a mentally disabled woman flailing her arms at a few protesters inside the cafe. Her
        urgency was a stark contrast to the lighthearted commotion just blocks away. Inside, people
        pointed their smartphones at her to capture the moment, unaware that this scene, raw and
        unresolved, was the day's most meaningful moment.
