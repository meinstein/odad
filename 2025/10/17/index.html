          <summary>1. The Web as an Archaeological Site</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Modern web apps = over-engineered sandcastles</li>
              <li>Dazzling but destined to decay when dependencies break and APIs change</li>
              <li>HTML = nuclear hardened bunkers</li>
              <li>Simple HTML pages are the most durable digital artifact we have</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

          <summary>2. Humility in Simplicity</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>I am not an expert. And that's exactly the point.</li>
              <li>HTML is not a specialist's language. It's a universal one.</li>
              <li>HTML is forgiving, resilient, and human-readable.</li>
              <li>You can make mistakes and your browser will still do its best to understand you.</li>
              <li>Anyone can build something lasting with it.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>3. HTML as Language, Not Tooling</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML isn't a framework. It's a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">specification</a> - a shared agreement between browsers and humans.</li>
              <li>Browsers are interpreters of that spec: they take your tags and render meaning.</li>
              <li>This universality and backward compatibility is why pages written 25+ years ago still work today.</li>
              <li>Space Jam <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996">website</a> from 1996 and even the world's first <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rez7r9/what_is_the_oldest_website_that_you_know_of_that/">website</a> still work today.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>4. The Beauty of Semantics</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML is <em>declarative</em>: you describe what something <strong>is</strong>, not what it <strong>does</strong>.</li>
              <li>Tags like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> give content structure and meaning.</li>
              <li>It's not just for browsers. It's for humans, search engines, assistive tech, and even future AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>5. The Layers That Followed</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>CSS brought style and JavaScript brought interactivity.</li>
              <li>Together, they turned static pages into living, breathing experiences.</li>
              <li>But beneath every React app, every animation, and every API call, there's still an HTML skeleton holding it all together.</li>
                <li>See <a href="https://github.com/opheliahealth/ophelia-web/blob/fileadmin/client/emr/src/index.tsx#L15">createRoot
                  </a> and <a href="https://github.com/opheliahealth/ophelia-web/blob/fileadmin/client/emr/src/index.html#L20">root</a></li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>6. The Age of Abstraction</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Modern development piles on abstractions. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Transpilers</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">frameworks</a>, <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">bundlers</a>.</li>
              <li>These empower us to build complex experiences, but also create distance from the web's foundation.</li>
              <li>We gain sophistication, but lose the ability to open a file in 10 years and just <em>understand it</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>7. AI and the Return to Semantics</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Ironically, AI models are <strong>excellent</strong> at writing semantic HTML.</li>
              <li>Why? Because it's clean, meaningful, structured, and timeless.</li>
              <li>AI can help us rediscover the simplicity and clarity that early web authors prized.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>8. The Miracle of Deployment</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>To publish your page to the world, you only need to upload one HTML file to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service">public web host</a>.</li>
              <li>That's it! A simple document accessible instantly across the planet.</li>
              <li>The web was, and still is, just documents linked together.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>9. HTML as Philosophy</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML = language of structure + intention.</li>
              <li>It's verbose at times, but that verbosity is clarity.</li>
              <li>Markdown, for example, may be simpler. But browsers don't <em>speak</em> it.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>10. Workshop: Crafting a Digital Artifact</summary>
            <ul>
            <li>Now, let's build something small but enduring.</li>
            <li>Each of you will create a semantic HTML page... a personal artifact, a time capsule.</li>
            <li>We'll deploy it to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://app.netlify.com/drop">Netlify Drop</a>, making it part of the living web.</li>
            <li>In minutes, you'll have something that could outlast every app in production today!</li>
            </ul>
