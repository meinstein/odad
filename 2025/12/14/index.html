      <em>[The following is my contribution to <a href="https://www.burnyourhits.com/">Burn Your Hits 2025</a> 💌]</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/mattmosphere">Mattmosphere</a> is the artist I listened to most on SoundCloud this
    year. I know almost nothing about him. The name itself feels earnestly, maybe even defiantly, uncool (though it can't
    be <em>that</em> uncool if Mattmosphere lives in Berlin). I came across his work while listening to a syndicated mix
    from the only other SoundCloud sets I reliably return to, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lautundluise/sets/montagssorbet">
    Montagssorbet</a>, which I've written about in <a href="https://www.burnyourhits.com/search/label/Max%20Einstein">past years</a>.
    This wasn't an algorithmic accident. I followed a thread from one account to another by hand, a small but oddly satisfying act
    of intention.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>With that self-conscious preamble out of the way, here's the truth: Mattmosphere's mixes are the shea butter to my
    long-gone dreadlocks. I had no business wearing my hair like that, and I have no business listening to something this
    groovy anymore. Still, at 1 a.m., fried by a coding assignment and out of ideas, I'll put on a set and start dancing
    like I've dissolved into a crowd. Somehow, it works just as well on bright Sunday mornings, or during family dinners,
    or whenever you need the room to loosen up a bit. Pick any mix - there will be at least one - and let it run.
