# iPhone Ownership Analysis Prompt

## ChatGPT Prompt Used

I bought an iPhone XS Max on December 15, 2018 for $1,099. I traded in that iPhone on August 15, 2025 for a $110 rebate value and I bought an iPhone 16e for $699. Can you slice this into some interesting data insights. For example:

- Number of days owned
- Cost of ownership per day
- Cost of ownership per month
- Depreciation
- Any other fun metrics

My plan is to make a little one sheet out of this that I want to publish to my simple HTML blog. No CSS. Just plain HTML.

## Purpose

This prompt was used to generate an HTML analysis page comparing iPhone ownership costs and depreciation over time.
